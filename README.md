# MachineLearning-Learning-Workflow

**I am a Computer Science graduate student. I have been working on a project. In this project, I use Apache Spark as an engine to run my machine learning algorithm and Deep Learning topics. Although, I was familiar to these topics, I realized that I need to improve my knowledge to get used to these topics for applying to my project. I am going to use this repository  and I will update as much as I can when I learn something new.**
